Just a quick update for this time. My wife's mother is not doing so well; therefore,
I could not dedicate as much to my projects for the past two weeks. Schedule should
clear up afterwards. Hopefully she gets much better soon!

##Tokyo Buffalo
Not that much going on, still working on the website for our first client.

##Learning Ruby!
Quite fun! I like the language but it can be a bit challenging getting it installed
properly. Python and Node were much easier in comparison.

##Give Me The Time!
Worked on my Chrome extension for a bit and finally got the UI to work. I can
probably start working on the different time zones soon!

Also, finishing up The Witcher 3. Amazing game.

I am planning to write another post about the tools that I use for web development.

See you soon!
