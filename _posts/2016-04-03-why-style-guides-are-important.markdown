summary:    Even in a small team, having a set of rules that everyone can follow will make life easier.

I remember being brought into a room at a previous job and told that I wasn't performing as
expected. One month into the job and the company was disappointed that I, as a
Front End Engineer, was unable to learn in-and-outs of how other developers on the
team wrote their code.

Problem was, there was no documentation. No structure. No style guides. Nothing.

This is why having documentation is important. Even in a small team, having
a set of rules that everyone can follow will make life easier. Creating and/or
agreeing on a style guide can take some time, but it will save plenty in the long
run.

In short, being organized can save your team time, money and ensures that your
team can work together.

### Which to choose?

With that said, there are a lot of style guides out there, so which one
should you adopt? Here's a small list that you can get started with. Hopefully, you
can find one that fits your style. Happy coding!

 [BEM](https://en.bem.info/) and [OOCSS](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/12/an-introduction-to-object-oriented-css-oocss/) are some of the major players.  

[SMACCS](https://smacss.com/) has also been around for quite some time. Airbnb is fairly new in
comparision but also has a fantastic guide that can be found [here](https://github.com/airbnb/css).
